# Check BTC Price - Bitcoin real-time price checker
**Live demo: https://mybt.cc**

## Why this site?
_— “Bro, just check the BTC price in Coinbase…_

No.

I don’t need apps to check the BTC price. I want a _simple way_ of checking the BTC price at a glance. I also despise notification alerts.

So, I created this simple site.

### FEATURES

1. Live BTC price (updates every 10 seconds.)
2. Price change % today (VS yesterday.)
3. Select currency (+ remember preference if you revisit.)
4. Price update in page title. Browse other sites & still see the BTC price in your tab.
